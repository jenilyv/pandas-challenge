This analysis focuses on the standardized test results for both math and reading across the district, comparing performance between charter and district schools. The analysis evaluates average test scores, the percentage of students passing each subject, and overall passing rates. These findings provide insight into trends in school performance, which can guide future decisions on budgeting and strategic priorities for the school district.
Charter Schools Significantly Outperform District Schools in Math and Reading
   The data reveals that charter schools consistently achieve higher average scores in both math and reading compared to district schools. Charter schools have an average math score of 83.47, while district schools have a score of 76.96. Similarly, charter schools have an average reading score of 83.90, outperforming district schools, which have an average score of 80.97. This trend indicates that students in charter schools are generally achieving better academic results than those in district schools.
Charter Schools Show Higher Passing Rates in Math and Reading
   In addition to higher test scores, charter schools have a significantly greater percentage of students passing both subjects. Specifically, 93.62% of charter school students passed math, compared to only 66.55% of district school students. The same pattern holds for reading, where 96.59% of charter school students passed, compared to 80.80% in district schools. This difference is also noticeable in the overall passing rate, with 90.43% of charter school students passing both math and reading, while only 53.67% of district school students achieved this. These results suggest that charter schools are more successful in helping students meet academic standards across both subjects.
This analysis underscores the substantial performance differences between charter and district schools. Charter schools not only achieve higher average scores but also show much higher passing rates.
